# Simplified Progress Tracking with Cookies

**Version:** V1.0.3 (Revised)

## Goal
Implement a simplified, reliable progress tracking system using cookies that accurately counts sections viewed and quizzes completed, with a fresh count on each training session.

## Key Requirements
- Reset progress counters each time a user enters the training page
- Increment section count in both cookie and database when a user views a section
- Update quiz completion count in both cookie and database when a user correctly answers a quiz
- Persist completion state across sessions using cookies
- Provide a clear visual indicator of progress through UI elements (checkboxes, progress bars)
- Allow users to reset their progress if desired

## Implementation Approach
- Simple counter-based tracking instead of storing individual section IDs
- Separate counters for sections viewed and quizzes completed
- Server-side validation of progress updates
- Client-side cookie storage for persistence between sessions
- Clear visual feedback when progress is updated

## Target Audience
- End users (trainees) using the training platform
- Instructors or admins tracking user progress

## Benefits of Revised Approach
- More reliable counting mechanism
- Simplified implementation with fewer edge cases
- Consistent user experience across different browsers and devices
- Reduced chance of data inconsistency between UI and stored values
