# Specification: V1.0.2f Training Page

## What are we building?
A Training Page for the sales enablement app that helps users learn about the product in a structured, interactive way. The content and structure are based on `content.md` and include collapsible sections and reinforcement questions.

## Why are we building it?
- To make training materials easy to navigate and engaging
- To help users track their learning progress
- To encourage active learning with reinforcement questions

## Features (What it should do)
- Show all training content, organized into clusters and components as in `content.md`
- The application must also incorporate three additional pages from `content.md`: Homepage, About, and Team. These pages must be rendered as separate pages or sections in the app, with content faithfully transferred and displayed, matching the standards for the Training Page.
- Each cluster header is always visible and not collapsible
- Only the information sections (components) within each cluster are collapsible (expand/collapse)
- Each section can display reinforcement questions, but these questions are hidden by default and only appear when a 'Questions' button is pressed for that section
- Reinforcement questions include show/hide answer functionality
- Content is built into the page during the build process (not loaded at runtime)

## Functional Requirements
- All content from `content.md` is displayed and organized as described above
- All displayed text on the Training Page must be the same and consistent with the source content in `content.md` (wording, spelling, and formatting should match unless minor adjustments are needed for clarity or accessibility)
- Collapsible sections work smoothly for all clusters/components
- Reinforcement questions for each section are hidden by default and only appear when a 'Questions' button is pressed for that section
- Reinforcement questions are present and users can show/hide answers
- Each section/component is clearly labeled

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The page is responsive (works on desktop and mobile)
- The UI is accessible (keyboard and screen-reader friendly)
- Build process for content is efficient (should not slow down builds)
- Content is sanitized for security

## Acceptance Criteria (How do we know itâ€™s done?)
- All clusters from `content.md` are visible (headers always shown)
- All components (information sections) within each cluster are collapsible
- All displayed text matches the source content in `content.md` (no missing, altered, or inconsistent text)
- Reinforcement questions for each section are hidden by default and only appear when a 'Questions' button is pressed for that section
- Reinforcement questions are interactive (show/hide answer)
- The page works on desktop and mobile devices
- All text is readable and navigation is clear

## Test Plan
- Walk through each section to check content and collapsibility
- Test reinforcement questions for interactivity
- Check on multiple devices and browsers
- Run accessibility audit tools
