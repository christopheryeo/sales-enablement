# Completion Summary: User Session Cookies (V1.0.2)

## Purpose
The User Session Cookies feature was implemented to provide persistent, secure session tracking for users of the sales enablement platform. This enables personalized experiences, analytics, and improved backend logic, while maintaining privacy and security standards.

## What Was Built
- On every visit to the app, the backend assigns a unique `session_id` (UUID) to each user if not already present, and stores it in a secure cookie. The cookie is set with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Lax flags for maximum security.
- The session ID persists across reloads and browser sessions, and is regenerated if deleted. The feature works silently with no UI changes, as specified.
- Manual and automated tests verified correct behavior: creation, persistence, regeneration, and security flags. The feature works across routes, browsers, and incognito sessions.

## Notable Design Decisions
- Only a UUID is stored in the cookie, with no personal data, ensuring privacy compliance.
- The implementation is backend-driven (Flask), with future extensibility for UI indicators or expiry modals if needed.
- Security best practices were followed for cookie handling, and the solution was verified both programmatically and manually.
