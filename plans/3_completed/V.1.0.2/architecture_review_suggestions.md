# Suggested Architecture Review for V1.0.2 (User Session Cookies)

The following sections in `architecture.md` may need review based on this feature:

- **Session Management / Authentication**: Document the new session_id logic and how it is used for user identification and persistence.
- **Security Considerations**: Note the use of Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookie flags for improved security and privacy compliance.
- **API/Backend Integration**: If the session_id is used for backend personalization or analytics, update this section to reflect the new logic.

*Do not edit architecture.md directly; these are suggestions for human review.*
