```
plans/
├── 0_backlog/           # New ideas and feature requests
├── 1_planning/          # Upcoming versions being planned
│   └── Vx.x.x/         # Version-specific planning
│       ├── README.md    # Version overview
│       ├── design.md    # Technical design decisions
│       ├── spec.md      # Detailed specifications
│       └── ai_prompts_log.md  # AI interaction history
├── 2_inprogress/        # Features currently in development

```

### 1. Backlog (`0_backlog/`)
- **Purpose**: Capture all new ideas, feature requests, and enhancements
- **Process**:
  - Create a new markdown file for each idea
  - Include problem statement, proposed solution, and potential impact
  - Tag with priority (P0-P3) and estimated effort (S/M/L/XL)
  - Review during weekly planning meetings

### 2. Planning (`1_planning/`)
- **Version Folders**: Each version follows semantic versioning (e.g., V1.2.3)
- **Required Files**:
  - `README.md`: Version overview and goals
  - `design.md`: Technical architecture and decisions
  - `spec.md`: Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
  - `ai_prompts_log.md`: Record of AI interactions

### 3. In Progress (`2_inprogress/`)
- **Purpose**: Track active development work
- **Guidelines**:
  - Create a branch for each feature/fix
  - Reference the planning documents
  - Update status regularly

### 4. Completed Work (`3_completed/`)
- **Purpose**: Archive of completed work
- **Included for each version**:
  - Final documentation
  - Test results
  - Retrospective notes

## Version Control

### Branch Naming Conventions
- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/login-validation`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks
- `release/` - Release preparation

### Commit Message Format
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## AI Collaboration

### Prompt Management
- **File**: `ai_prompts_log.md` in each version directory
- **What to log**:
  - Initial prompts and refinements
  - Key decisions and rationale
  - Successful patterns and anti-patterns
  - Context and constraints provided

### Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**
   - Clearly define the task
   - Provide necessary context
   - Specify the desired output format

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start with high-level prompts
   - Refine based on outputs
   - Document iterations

3. **Security**
   - Never include sensitive data
   - Review outputs for security implications
   - Follow data handling guidelines

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Verify component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Validate complete user flows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure system meets performance requirements

### Code Review Process
1. **Pre-Submit**
   - Self-review your changes
   - Run all relevant tests
   - Update documentation

2. **Review Request**
   - Assign appropriate reviewers
   - Provide context and testing details
   - Link related issues

3. **Review Guidelines**
   - Check for correctness and completeness
   - Verify test coverage
   - Ensure code style consistency
   - Consider security implications

## Workflow

### 3.1. Idea Capture (Backlog)
- All new ideas, feature requests, and enhancements are first documented in `0_backlog/`.
- Ideas are reviewed and prioritized during planning cycles.

### 3.2. Planning
- Selected features are moved to `1_planning/`, organized by target version.
- Each planned version receives detailed documentation:
  - **Design**: System architecture, UX/UI, data flow, and technical decisions
  - **Specification**: Functional and non-functional requirements, test cases, and success criteria

### 3.3. In Progress
- Features under active development may be tracked in `2_inprogress/` (if used).
- This stage supports coordination between team members and helps avoid duplication or conflicts.

### 3.4. Completion & Archiving
- Upon completion, all documentation and artifacts are moved to `3_completed/` under the relevant version.
- A summary and any lessons learned, architecture reviews, or scripts are included for future reference.

### 3.5. Reference & Templates
- The `_reference/` directory provides quick access to logs and methodology.
- The `_templates/` directory ensures all documentation follows a consistent structure, making onboarding and audits easier.

## Templates & Examples

### Available Templates

#### 1. Work in Progress (WIP) Template
**Location:** `_templates/wip_template.md`  
**When to Use:** When starting work on a new feature or enhancement  
**Purpose:** Guides the planning and documentation of new features from ideation to implementation-ready state

**Key Components:**
- Feature identification and naming
- Requirements gathering
- Design considerations
- Implementation planning

#### 2. Completed Feature Template
**Location:** `_templates/completed_template.md`  
**When to Use:** When a feature is completed and ready for review  
**Purpose:** Documents the completed feature for knowledge sharing and future reference

**Key Components:**
- Feature summary
- Implementation details
- Testing results
- Architecture impact

### How to Use the Templates

1. **For New Features:**
   - Copy `wip_template.md` to your version folder in `1_planning/`
   - Follow the template's instructions to document the feature
   - Move to `2_inprogress/` when development starts
   - Upon completion, use `completed_template.md` to document the final state

2. **For Quick Reference:**
   - Use the templates as checklists to ensure all aspects are covered
   - Customize sections as needed for your specific feature

### Example Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Idea] -->|Create| B[Backlog Item]
    B -->|Prioritize| C[Planning]
    C -->|Use wip_template.md| D[Development]
    D -->|Complete| E[Use completed_template.md]
    E --> F[Documentation]
    F --> G[Review & Archive]
```

### Template Maintenance
- Templates are living documents - suggest improvements as needed
- Keep templates in sync with this guide
- Document any customizations in the template's header

## Best Practices

### For Developers
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Document assumptions and decisions
- Review your own code before submitting

### For Documentation
- Keep it up to date
- Use consistent formatting
- Include examples
- Link to related resources
- Make it searchable

### For Collaboration
- Communicate early and often
- Be specific in feedback
- Assume positive intent
- Document decisions
- Share knowledge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Merge Conflicts**
   - Pull latest changes frequently
   - Use `git rebase` to keep history clean
   - Resolve conflicts carefully

2. **Build Failures**
   - Check error messages
   - Verify dependencies
   - Ensure environment consistency

3. **Test Failures**
   - Reproduce locally
   - Check for environmental differences
   - Review recent changes

## Glossary

- **Sprint**: A time-boxed development cycle (typically 2 weeks)
- **Epic**: A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller stories
- **User Story**: A requirement expressed from the user's perspective
- **Technical Debt**: The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

## 7. Applicability

This method is suitable for:
- AI/ML projects with evolving requirements
- Software teams needing lightweight but rigorous process
- Startups and research teams balancing speed and documentation

It can be adapted for more formal methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) or used as a standalone lightweight process.
