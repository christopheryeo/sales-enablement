- Comprehensive review of project structure, directory contents, and key files (README.md, content.md, templates/index.html).

- Mapped out the interactive training features: collapsible sections, progress tracking, reinforcement questions, and dynamic content rendering from markdown.
- Documented the integration of Flask backend, markdown-driven content pipeline, and rich front-end interactivity.
- Ensured all findings are up-to-date and reflected in project documentation.
