# AI Prompts Log for V1.0.2f

## 2025-05-08 (13 prompts)
- Now, following the method outline in product_management, I want to work on a new version called V1.0.2f which builds the Training Page of this application which follows the content and structure of what is currently in contend.md, along with collapsible content sections, and reinforcement questions. Create the neccesary sub-directory and files in 1_planning directory, as well as modifying feature-idea.md accordingingly
- I do not need the app to read content.md dynamically, only during build-time, please change all the relevant documents
- Look at the features that have completed being built, reflect feature-idea.md accordingly so we know which features are being planned, implemented and completed.
- Is it possible to log all the prompts I am using here to develop each version in my project?
- Start logging each version's prompts in its own directory, include only the prompts, not the AI response. This way I can track how many prompts it took to develop each version.
- Actually what's the difference between spec.md and design.md?
- Yes add
- Following what you just wrote above, revise the spec.md and design.md of the version V1.0.2f accordingly
- Update the relevant ai_prompts_log file
- Does spec.md mention that all the sections are collapsible, and contain reinforcement questions, and that the reinforcement questions for each section only appear when a questions button is pressed?
- yes update
- Ensure that the above is planned carefully in design.md as well
- update ai_prompts_logs
