# Quiz Completion Cookies

**Version:** V1.0.4

## Goal
As an initial implementation for V1.0.4, use cookies to track whether the *first question* in the training page has been completed by the user. When the user revisits the training page, the app will read this cookie and visually indicate if the first question was previously completed. This will serve as a pilot for potentially broader progress tracking.

## Key Requirements
- Track whether the *first question* of the training page has been completed.
- Store this completion state in a cookie for persistence.
- When the user enters the training page, restore the visual indication of the first question's completion status based on the cookie.
- Ensure this initial implementation can be extended for more granular tracking (all sections/quizzes) in the future.

## Target Audience
- End users (trainees) taking quizzes.
- Instructors or admins monitoring quiz performance.

## Open Questions
- What data model best captures quiz completion and scores in a cookie?
- How to handle updates if quiz structure changes?
- Should users be able to reset quiz progress?
