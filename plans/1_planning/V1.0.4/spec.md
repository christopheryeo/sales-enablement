# Specification: Quiz Completion Cookies

**Version:** V1.0.4

## Intended Functionality
- Use a cookie to track whether the *first question* in the training page has been completed by the user.
- When the user revisits the training page, the app will read this cookie.
- If the cookie indicates completion, the UI will visually reflect that the first question has been previously addressed (e.g., checkbox ticked, section expanded, or a specific message).
- Store this completion state in a cookie for persistence.
- This functionality serves as an initial step and should be designed for potential future expansion to cover all questions and sections.
- A user-initiated reset of progress should clear this cookie.

## Technical Scope
- Use `document.cookie` for persistence on the client-side.
- Cookie name: A dedicated name, for example, `training_first_question_completed`.
- Cookie value: A simple boolean representation (e.g., 'true' or '1').
- The cookie will be set (or updated) when the user completes an action indicating the first question is done (e.g., submitting an answer, revealing the answer for the first question).
- JavaScript will handle reading this cookie on page load to update the UI.

## UI Treatments / Layout Options
1. **Quiz completion checklist:**
   - Each completed quiz shows a checkmark.
2. **Score summary modal:**
   - After quiz, show a modal with score and feedback.
3. **Achievement badges:**
   - Award badges for high scores or all quizzes completed.

## Trade-offs
- **Checklist:** Simple and familiar, but may not motivate users.
- **Score modal:** Immediate feedback, but can interrupt flow.
- **Badges:** Motivational, but adds gamification complexity.
