# Section Completion Cookies

**Version:** V1.0.3

## Goal
Store section completion status in cookies so users can resume training where they left off and visualize their progress even if not logged in.

## Key Requirements
- Track which training sections a user has completed.
- Persist completion state across sessions using cookies.
- Integrate with existing progress UI (checkboxes, progress bars).
- Allow for future migration to server-side tracking if needed.

## Target Audience
- End users (trainees) using the training platform.
- Instructors or admins tracking user progress.

## Open Questions
- What is the optimal cookie structure for storing multiple section states?
- How to handle updates if section structure changes?
- Should there be a mechanism to clear/reset progress?
